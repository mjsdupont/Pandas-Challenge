# Pandas-Challenge
Hello! Please find my assignment/Jupyter Notebook as Pandas-Challenge.ipynb in the folder PyCitySchools.
I found I had to tweak some code in order to get it running: in lines 142 and 143 I had to make the column numeric to get the code to run. I found this line of code, and all my tweaks, from stackoverflow.com as others users had encountered similar problems in the past and I just adapted it for this challenge. 
In line 150 I again had to change the column to numeric to get it to change.
In lines 164 and 165 I had to check the string for the final dataframe as it would not have run otherwise. 
I'm not sure if these solutions are necessarily correct or if there was some other way I should have done it, but it made the challenge run through for me.
